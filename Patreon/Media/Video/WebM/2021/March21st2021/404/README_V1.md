# Patreon 404 videos

I finally got to make video of the Patreon 404 page today and learn how to screen capture in Ubuntu, this task has been held off for several days. As far as I know, Ubuntu screen capture by the system is limited to 30 seconds.

Patreon has a really cool 404 page, and I wanted to have a copy of it.

## 14 second version
